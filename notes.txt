why do we move to Cloud ?
1) Manageability, avioding physical servers for our startups blah blah, 
2) cost effective  , if we have physical servers, then we have to pay anyway, but if you have 
cloud, then you can follow pay as you go 

to remove any sort of maintenance overhead and also cost overhead, organizations shift to Cloud 

we can track our resources 

EC2, S3  Lambda IAM 


we should report this information to a reporting dashboard 

SHELL > file or DB


CronJOB -- > one of the linux processes executes a shell script for you at X timestamp

we write a shell script and we integrate it with a CronJOB
